# CodeAlpha_IrisFlowersClassification
Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classes are sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories. Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).
For example, spam detection in email service providers can be identified as a classification problem. This is s binary classification since there are only 2 classes as spam and not spam. A classifier utilizes some training data to understand how given input variables relate to the class. In this case, known spam and non-spam emails have to be used as the training data. When the classifier is trained accurately, it can be used to detect an unknown email.
Classification belongs to the category of supervised learning where the targets also provided with the input data. There are many applications in classification in many domains such as in credit approval, medical diagnosis, target marketing etc.

in this Task the main goal is to train a machine learning model that accurately classifies Iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal measurements.

### Local Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git
cd iris-classification

2.Install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

After installation, you can:

*Run the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook iris_classification.ipynb
*Make new predictions by modifying the example:

Dataset
The project uses the classic Iris dataset with the following features:

Sepal length (cm)
Sepal width (cm)
Petal length (cm)
Petal width (cm)

Target classes:
Iris-setosa
Iris-versicolor
Iris-virginica

How It Works
Data is split into training (80%) and test sets (20%)

Logistic Regression model is trained

Model is evaluated on test data

Example prediction demonstrates usage
